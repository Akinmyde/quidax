# Assumptions
I make us of React Context to manage my state. Expecially the part of persisting the cart. An alternative would have been making use of a store like redux or perhaps use the the Async-Storage package.

I make use of Context API because I really don't want to add another layer of obfuscation to the code. I see the application a basic as it is since I only need to manage few states and data.

# Requirements
Due to time, I was not able to perfectly implement the search feature to my taste and the taste of the requiremnt. Although, it is hard to notice that something is off.

## Issues
The main issue is faced completing this assessment is time. due to my current tight schedule,I was only able to dedicate few hours of my time for this assessment.
